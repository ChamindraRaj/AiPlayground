# Key Definitions and Outcomes for Increment 18 Planning Day

This document provides key definitions and expected outcomes relevant to the Increment 18 Planning Day.

*   **Chapters:** Teams that carry out key delivery for other teams in the program. Examples include Infrastructure teams (managing cloud/on-premise infrastructure) and Automation teams (developing business automations and integrations). Chapters primarily support other teams.
*   **Squads:** Teams that primarily have ownership of their delivery priorities. They control and own the epics to be delivered within the quarter, though they may depend on other teams (including Chapters) for sub-sections of their delivery epics.
*   **SLT (Senior Leadership Team):** Composed of the Chief Digital & Information Officer, Executive Managers, Enterprise Agile Coach, and Agile Coach. They are involved in discussions regarding risks and blockers raised by teams.
*   **Expected Outcome of the Day:** All Delivery Squads and Chapters will have a committed plan defined in Jira (including epics and their associated stories). Any dependencies on other squads or chapters will be well understood and accepted. Teams will also raise any risks or blockers that need attention from the SLT for discussion.
*   **Risk/Blockers - SLT Discussion:** This session involves senior leadership (Executing Managers) discussing any blockers or risks raised by the teams on a ROAM board. Iteration Managers and Product Owners of each Chapter and Delivery Squad will attend. The outcome is an understanding of any risks or blockers raised and an agreed way forward for each item, which will be categorized as Resolved, Owned, Accepted, or Mitigated (ROAM).
*   **Dependency Management:** In the lead-up to Increment Planning, teams will have discussions to identify and define dependencies. Teams depending on others will define the dependency, when it is needed, and when the team carrying out the work can accommodate it. Through these discussions, dependencies will be either accepted, blocked, or rejected. An accepted dependency will transition to "planned" when scheduled in a sprint, "in progress" when work commences, and "completed" when work is finished.
*   **Capacity and Load Balancing:** This is done at a squad level with the help of Iteration Managers. Teams and Chapters use capacity planning spreadsheets and their historical velocity from previous increments to determine their capacity. Individual team member availability is factored into these spreadsheets, allowing for an estimation of overall team capacity sprint-to-sprint and for the entire 6-sprint increment. Teams break down their delivery epics into stories in the lead-up to the planning day, and these stories are estimated to understand the estimated size of each epic. Epics are prioritized by Product Owners and the SLT, providing teams with an overall priority focus for the epics to be delivered.
