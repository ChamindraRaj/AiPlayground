# A Guide to ROAM Boards and Facilitation

This document explains the ROAM board methodology for managing risks and provides a guide for an Agile Coach on how to facilitate a ROAMing session.

## How a ROAM Board is Used

A ROAM board is a tool used to categorize and manage risks, blockers, and impediments identified during planning sessions. The acronym **ROAM** stands for the four categories that each identified risk will be placed into:

*   **R - Resolved:** The risk or issue has been addressed and is no longer a concern. No further action is needed.
*   **O - Owned:** Someone has taken ownership of the risk. This person is responsible for developing a plan to address it and will provide updates on its progress. The risk is not yet resolved, but it is being actively managed.
*   **A - Accepted:** The team and leadership have acknowledged the risk but have decided to take no immediate action. This is typically for risks that are low in probability or impact, or where the cost of mitigation is too high. The risk is accepted as a potential problem that may have to be dealt with later.
*   **M - Mitigated:** A plan is in place to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk. The team has identified specific actions to take to lessen the potential negative effects, even if the risk cannot be fully resolved.

During the planning event, teams identify risks and write them on cards or sticky notes. These are then brought to the "Risk/Blockers - SLT Discussion" where each one is discussed and collectively moved into one of the four ROAM categories by the relevant stakeholders.

## How an Agile Coach Facilitates the ROAM Discussion

An Agile Coach is key to ensuring the ROAMing process is efficient, collaborative, and effective.

### Preparation
*   Set up a large, visible ROAM board (physical or digital) with the four columns clearly marked.
*   Ensure all identified risks from the teams are collected and ready for discussion.
*   Timebox the session to maintain focus and energy.

### During the Session
1.  **Introduce the Process:** Start by briefly explaining the purpose of the session and the meaning of each category (Resolved, Owned, Accepted, Mitigated) to ensure everyone has a shared understanding.
2.  **Address Risks One by One:** Read out each risk to the group. The team that raised it should provide a brief (1-2 minute) overview of the risk and its potential impact.
3.  **Guide the Conversation:** The coach's role is to guide the discussion, not to solve the problem. Use powerful questions to help the group come to a decision:
    *   "Who needs to be involved in solving this?"
    *   "What is the next concrete action we can take?"
    *   "Does anyone have the authority to own and resolve this?"
    *   "What would happen if we chose to accept this risk?"
4.  **Drive to a Decision:** For each risk, ensure the group decides which ROAM category it belongs to.
    *   If **Owned**, get a specific name of the person who will own it. The owner is now responsible for follow-up.
    *   If **Mitigated**, ensure the mitigation plan is briefly discussed and understood.
    *   If **Accepted**, confirm that the key stakeholders agree that no action will be taken at this time.
    *   If **Resolved**, briefly acknowledge the resolution and move on.
5.  **Maintain Focus:** Keep the conversation on track and ensure all risks are addressed within the timebox. If a discussion is taking too long, the coach might suggest taking it offline with a smaller group and moving on.

### After the Session
*   Ensure the final state of the ROAM board is captured (e.g., by taking a photo of a physical board or saving a digital one).
*   Distribute the outcomes to all attendees so there is transparency on how each risk is being handled.
