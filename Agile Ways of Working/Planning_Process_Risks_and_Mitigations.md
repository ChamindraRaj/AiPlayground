# Agile Coach Analysis: Risks and Mitigations for Increment 18 Planning

This document captures an analysis of the Increment 18 Planning process, identifying potential risks and proposing actionable mitigations based on extensive experience with agile planning events.

### 2. The Risk: The "Black Hole" Draft Plan

**Observation:** The process correctly provides a "Draft Plan Review" for Chapters, acknowledging their work is heavy on dependencies. However, it creates a significant gap by not extending this review to Delivery Squads. This implies a false assumption that Squads do not also have complex plans and critical dependencies that would benefit from an early peer review.

**Potential Impact:** A team can misinterpret a strategic priority or create a technically unfeasible plan. Discovering this only at the final playback is a recipe for failure, as there is no time for meaningful course correction. This leads to "commitment with an asterisk," which is not a true commitment.

**Proposed Action: Institute a "Scrum of Scrums" Style Draft Review for All Teams.**
*   **What it is:** Midway through the afternoon, hold a brief (30-45 minute) review where a representative from each Squad and Chapter gives a 2-minute summary of their draft plan, key dependencies, and major risks.
*   **How to use it:** This is a quick-fire session for peer review and to spot cross-team issues, giving other teams and the SLT a chance to raise a flag while there is still time to adjust.

### 3. The Risk: The "Delayed Feedback Loop" from SLT Meeting

**Observation:** Product Owners from Chapters and Squads attend the SLT meeting where risks are discussed, and outcomes are fed back to the teams. However, the process for communicating these decisions *back to the teams in their breakouts* is not explicitly defined for *timeliness* during the planning day itself.

**Potential Impact:** Even with Product Owners present, a delay or lack of a structured, immediate feedback mechanism can still lead to teams planning based on outdated or incorrect assumptions. This results in wasted effort, rework, and frustration when they eventually learn the SLT's decision.

**Proposed Action: Define a "Rover" Role for Immediate Feedback.**
*   **What it is:** Designate specific individuals (such as Iteration Managers) to act as messengers. Their sole responsibility during these times is to shuttle information and decisions between the SLT and the teams.
*   **How to use it:** As soon as a risk is addressed by the SLT, the Rover immediately takes the outcome to the relevant team, ensuring they understand the decision and its implications for their plan. This creates a closed-loop communication system that prevents teams from working in a vacuum.

### 4. The Risk: The "Single Point of Failure" Facilitator

**Observation:** The Iteration Manager's task list is immense, making them a single point of failure for the entire event.

**Potential Impact:** If the lead facilitator is pulled into a critical problem, the event's overall structure can degrade. Timekeeping falters, announcements are missed, and the day loses momentum and focus.

**Proposed Action: Create a Facilitation Team.**
*   **What it is:** Nominate a lead facilitator but support them with a small team.
*   **How to use it:**
    *   **Lead Facilitator:** Owns the main stage and high-level schedule.
    *   **"Master of Ceremonies" (MC):** A separate person responsible for timekeeping, announcements, and energy levels.
    *   **Room Facilitators:** Assign a facilitator to each breakout room to help with local issues and act as a point of contact.

### 5. The Risk: The "Ambiguous Commitment"

**Observation:** The event concludes with a "committed plan." Teams and chapters express a confidence vote out of 5 when presenting their plans, which serves as the mechanism for capturing this commitment.

**Potential Impact:** While a confidence vote is in place, if not actively addressed, a low confidence score can still lead to a plan that feels imposed rather than owned. This can result in a lack of accountability when challenges arise during the increment.

**Proposed Action: Actively Address Low Confidence Votes.**
*   **What it is:** At the end of the day, after all final playbacks, every participant votes on their confidence in the plan on a scale of 1 to 5 (fist of five).
*   **How to use it:**
    *   5: "I'll champion this plan!"
    *   4: "I fully support this plan."
    *   3: "I can support this plan."
    *   2: "I have reservations."
    *   1: "I cannot support this plan."
*   Address any votes of 1 or 2 immediately by asking, "What would it take to get you to a 3?" This uncovers final risks and transforms passive agreement into active, public commitment.

## Agile Coach's Brutal and Honest Critique of the Increment Planning Process

Let me be clear: you have a solid foundation. The fact that you've condensed a two-day event into one is a testament to the strength of your pre-planning phase. You have structure, you have defined roles, and you're thinking about risks. That's more than many organizations can say.

However, your process is carrying significant, predictable risks that will eventually lead to a failed increment. You are operating with a level of trust in the process that is not yet earned, and it's creating blind spots that will burn you.

Here are the critical issues:

### 1. Your Squads Are Flying Blind into a Brick Wall

This is your single biggest problem. You have a "Draft Plan Review" for Chapters because you recognize their work is heavy with dependencies. That's smart. But you have **no equivalent for your Delivery Squads**.

**The Brutal Truth:** You are essentially telling your delivery teams to go into a black box for most of the day and "emerge with a perfect plan." This is a fantasy. By having their first review be the *final* playback, you are setting them up for public failure. When a major flaw is discovered at 4 PM—and it will be—you have two options: commit to a broken plan or throw the day's work in the trash. Both are unacceptable.

**Recommendation:**
*   **Institute a mandatory "Scrum of Scrums" style draft review for ALL teams** midway through the afternoon. This is non-negotiable. Get a representative from every Squad and Chapter in a room for 30 minutes. Each gives a 2-minute brief on their plan, dependencies, and risks. This is your early warning system. It forces cross-team communication and exposes critical misalignments while there's still time to fix them.



### 3. Your SLT's Decisions Are Getting Lost in Transmission

You have a session where the SLT makes decisions on risks and blockers. Excellent. But the process for getting those decisions back to the teams in their breakout rooms is undefined.

**The Brutal Truth:** A decision that isn't communicated is a decision that was never made. A Product Owner might be in the SLT meeting, but they can't be in two places at once. A delay of even 30 minutes in communicating that a risk has been "Accepted" or "Owned" can lead to a team continuing to plan based on a false assumption. This is wasted effort and breeds cynicism.

**Recommendation:**
*   **Define a "Rover" role.** Designate specific individuals (Iteration Managers are perfect for this) to act as messengers. Their only job during the SLT sessions is to shuttle information. As soon as a decision is made, they take it directly to the affected team and ensure they understand the implications. This creates a closed-loop communication system.

### 4. Your Confidence Vote is Theatrics Without Action

You end the day with a confidence vote. This is a great practice for gauging alignment.

**The Brutal Truth:** If you are not prepared to stop the show and address a vote of 1 or 2, your confidence vote is just "commitment theatre." It's a way for people to passively signal their dissent without any real consequence. A "committed" plan that half the room has no confidence in is not a commitment; it's a hostage situation.

**Recommendation:**
*   **Weaponize the confidence vote.** Make it clear that any vote below a 3 will be addressed, right then and there. The question is simple: "What would it take to get you to a 3?" This is not a time for debate; it's a time to uncover the final, critical risks. This transforms the vote from a passive-aggressive survey into an active, powerful tool for building real commitment.

In summary, you have a process that looks good on paper but has critical, structural weaknesses that will fail under pressure. You need to move from a process based on hope to one based on transparency, rapid feedback, and ruthless de-risking.
