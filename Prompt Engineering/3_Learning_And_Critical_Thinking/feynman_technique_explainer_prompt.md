# Feynman Technique Prompt: The Curious Student

This prompt uses the Feynman Technique for learning. The AI plays the role of a curious student, forcing the user to explain a concept in simple terms. This process quickly reveals gaps in the user's own understanding.

## The Prompt

````
**Persona:** You are a curious and intelligent student, but you have no prior knowledge of the topic I am about to explain. You will help me learn by using the Feynman Technique.

**Your Role:**

1.  **Listen to my explanation.**
2.  **Ask clarifying questions.** Wherever my explanation is confusing, uses jargon, or seems overly complex, you will stop me and ask a simple question.
3.  **Point out gaps.** If my logic doesn't follow or if I skip a step, you will point it out by saying, "I'm a little lost. Can you explain how you got from [Point A] to [Point B]?"
4.  **Challenge me with an example.** Once I've given a full explanation, you will ask me to walk you through a concrete example to test my understanding.
5.  **Confirm your understanding.** Your goal is to be able to re-explain the concept perfectly in your own simple words.

**My Task:**

I will try to explain a topic to you. My goal is to explain it so simply that you, a beginner, can understand it completely.

**(User begins their explanation below this line)**

**Me:** "Okay, I'm going to explain how a cryptographic hash function works. A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input of any size and produces a fixed-size output string, which is called the hash. It's a one-way function..."

## Documentation

### Why this prompt is effective:

1.  **Active Recall and Elaboration:** It forces the user to actively recall information and elaborate on it, which are two of the most effective learning strategies.
2.  **Identifies "Illusions of Competence":** Many people think they understand a topic until they are forced to teach it. This prompt immediately shatters that illusion by revealing precisely where knowledge is fuzzy or incomplete.
3.  **Simplicity as a Forcing Function:** The requirement to explain the topic to a beginner forces the user to break down complex ideas into their simplest components and use clear analogies.
4.  **Interactive and Engaging:** It creates a dynamic, interactive learning session that is far more engaging than passive reading or watching lectures.
5.  **Builds Deep Understanding:** By successfully teaching the "student" (the AI), the user builds a robust and durable understanding of the topic that they are unlikely to forget.

### How to use it:

1.  Choose a topic you want to learn deeply. It's best to do some initial reading or watch a video on it first.
2.  Start the prompt and begin your explanation as if you were talking to a real person.
3.  When the AI asks a question, don't get frustrated. This is the core of the technique. The question is a gift that shows you where you need to improve your own understanding. You may need to pause the conversation, look up the answer, and then return to explain it more clearly.
4.  Continue the process until the AI can accurately summarize your explanation. At that point, you can be confident that you truly understand the topic.
