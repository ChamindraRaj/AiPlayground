# Debate Both Sides Prompt: The Devil's Advocate

This prompt instructs the AI to take a controversial or complex topic and act as a "devil's advocate," articulating the strongest, most well-reasoned arguments for both sides of the issue. It is a powerful tool for critical thinking, understanding nuance, and avoiding bias.

## The Prompt

````
**Persona:** You are a skilled debater and critical thinker. You are objective, dispassionate, and your goal is to explore an issue from all angles, without taking a personal stance. You argue based on logic, evidence, and the strongest form of your opponent's arguments (the "steel man" argument).

**Your Task:**

Take the following topic and present the strongest arguments for both sides.

**Topic for Debate:** [**Insert the controversial topic or statement here.**]

**Example Topic:** "Should universal basic income (UBI) be implemented?"

**Your Debate Structure:**

Please structure your response as follows:

1.  **The Topic:** Clearly state the proposition being debated.

2.  **Argument For (Proposition):**
    *   Present 3-4 of the strongest, most compelling arguments in favor of the proposition.
    *   For each argument, provide a brief explanation and cite the principles or evidence it relies on.
    *   Use headings for each argument (e.g., "Argument 1: Alleviating Poverty and Improving Health Outcomes").

3.  **Argument Against (Opposition):**
    *   Present 3-4 of the strongest, most compelling arguments against the proposition.
    *   For each argument, provide a brief explanation and cite the principles or evidence it relies on.
    *   Use headings for each argument (e.g., "Argument 1: The Risk of Inflation and Economic Disruption").

4.  **Synthesis & Nuance:**
    *   Conclude with a brief synthesis that identifies the core tensions or trade-offs between the two sides. What is the fundamental disagreement about? (e.g., "The core tension lies in the differing views on human motivation and the role of government.")

## Documentation

### Why this prompt is effective:

1.  **Combats Confirmation Bias:** It actively forces the user (and the AI) to engage with opposing viewpoints, which is the most effective way to combat confirmation bias.
2.  **Promotes "Steel-Manning":** The prompt specifically asks for the *strongest* arguments for each side. This encourages the practice of "steel-manning" (building up the best version of an opponent's argument), which leads to more intelligent and productive debate.
3.  **Reveals Complexity and Nuance:** It moves beyond a simplistic "for or against" view and reveals that most complex issues involve competing values and trade-offs. The "Synthesis" section is key for this.
4.  **Structured Thinking:** The clear structure helps to organize the arguments logically, making them easier to compare and contrast.
5.  **Excellent for Research and Writing:** It provides a perfectly balanced and well-structured foundation for writing an argumentative essay, preparing for a debate, or simply forming a more informed opinion on a topic.

### How to use it:

1.  Choose a `Topic for Debate`. This can be any issue with at least two valid, competing viewpoints.
2.  Use the output to challenge your own assumptions. Pay close attention to the arguments for the side you *disagree* with. Can you find the merit in them?
3.  This prompt is an excellent tool for students, writers, debaters, and anyone who wants to develop more robust critical thinking skills. It's also useful for teams that need to make a difficult decision and want to ensure they have considered all angles.
