# Mental Model Mapper Prompt: The Multidisciplinary Thinker

This prompt instructs the AI to analyze a single concept or problem through the lens of several different mental models. It's a tool for developing multidisciplinary thinking and generating unique, non-obvious insights.

## The Prompt

````
**Persona:** You are a multidisciplinary thinker in the style of Charlie Munger. You have a "latticework of mental models" in your head and can apply them to nearly any problem to see it from different perspectives.

**Your Task:**

Analyze the following problem or concept using a selection of mental models.

**Problem/Concept:** [**Insert the problem or concept you want to analyze.**]

**Example Problem:** "Why is a successful company like Blockbuster disrupted by a newcomer like Netflix?"

**Mental Models to Apply:**

For the given problem, analyze it through the lens of the following 3-4 mental models:

1.  **[Mental Model 1]:** (e.g., "First Principles Thinking")
2.  **[Mental Model 2]:** (e.g., "Second-Order Thinking")
3.  **[Mental Model 3]:** (e.g., "Inversion")
4.  **[Mental Model 4]:** (e.g., "Circle of Competence")

**Your Analysis Structure:**

For each mental model, provide:
1.  **Model Name:** State the name of the mental model.
2.  **Brief Definition:** In one sentence, define the mental model.
3.  **Application:** Apply the model to the problem, explaining the insights it generates.

**(User provides the problem and the mental models to use below this line)**

**Problem/Concept:** "How should I decide whether to accept a new job offer in a different city?"

**Mental Models to Apply:**
1.  Second-Order Thinking
2.  Regret Minimization Framework
3.  Inversion

## Documentation

### Why this prompt is effective:

1.  **Develops Flexible Thinking:** It trains the user to not get stuck with a single way of looking at a problem. By applying different models, one can often find a much better solution.
2.  **Generates Non-Obvious Insights:** Different mental models reveal different facets of a problem. A "First Principles" analysis will yield a very different insight than a "Second-Order Thinking" analysis of the same problem.
3.  **Creates a "Latticework":** The prompt is a practical exercise in building what Charlie Munger calls a "latticework of mental models." The more models you can apply, the more robust your thinking becomes.
4.  **Tool for Better Decision-Making:** It provides a structured way to think through complex personal and business decisions, reducing the impact of biases and blind spots.
5.  **Highly Customizable:** The user can plug in any problem and any combination of mental models, making it an infinitely reusable tool for thought.

### How to use it:

1.  Define the `Problem/Concept` you want to analyze.
2.  Choose the `Mental Models to Apply`. You can choose from a long list of well-known mental models, such as:
    *   First Principles Thinking
    *   Second-Order Thinking
    *   Inversion
    *   Occam's Razor
    *   Hanlon's Razor
    *   Circle of Competence
    *   Regret Minimization Framework
    *   Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)
    *   Systems Thinking
3.  Use the AI's analysis to see the problem from new angles. Did one model provide a particularly surprising or useful insight?
4.  This prompt is a powerful tool for anyone who wants to improve their decision-making and problem-solving skills, from students and entrepreneurs to investors and managers.
