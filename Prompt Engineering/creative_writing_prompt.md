# Creative Writing Prompt: The Story Weaver

This prompt is designed to elicit rich, detailed, and imaginative creative writing from the AI. It provides a structured framework of creative constraints that helps guide the model's imagination.

## The Prompt

```
**Objective:** Write a short story based on the elements provided below.

**Core Concept:** A world where emotions can be physically captured, stored, and consumed.

**Protagonist:**
*   **Name:** Kaelen
*   **Occupation:** An "Emotion Harvester," someone who collects intense emotions from people experiencing them.
*   **Motivation:** He is trying to save his younger sister, who has fallen into a state of emotional void, unable to feel anything. He believes that a rare, pure emotion can save her.

**Key Elements to Include:**

1.  **The Setting:** A neon-lit, perpetually twilight city, where the trade of bottled emotions is a booming black market industry. Describe the "Aetherium," the central marketplace for these emotions.
2.  **The Inciting Incident:** Kaelen hears a rumor about a person who has generated an emotion so pure and powerful it is considered a myth: "Pristine Joy."
3.  **The Conflict:** The emotion is not for sale. It was generated by a reclusive artist who refuses to part with it. Kaelen must find the artist and convince them to give him the emotion.
4.  **A Specific Sensory Detail:** The story must describe the "taste" or "scent" of at least three different emotions (e.g., what does bottled anger smell like? What does distilled sadness taste like?).
5.  **The Climax:** The confrontation with the artist, where a secret about the nature of emotions is revealed.

**Literary Style:**
*   **Genre:** Sci-Fi Noir
*   **Tone:** Hopeful yet melancholic.
*   **Point of View:** Third-person limited, focusing on Kaelen's perspective and inner thoughts.
*   **Literary Devices:** Please use at least one metaphor and one instance of foreshadowing.

**Word Count:** Approximately 500-700 words.

## Documentation

### Why this prompt is effective:

1.  **Strong Core Concept:** It starts with a unique and intriguing "what if" scenario that immediately sparks imagination.
2.  **Detailed Characters and Motivations:** It provides a clear protagonist with a relatable and powerful motivation. This gives the story an emotional anchor.
3.  **Structured Plot Points:** Instead of just asking for "a story," it provides key plot beats (Inciting Incident, Conflict, Climax). This gives the AI a narrative arc to follow, preventing the story from meandering.
4.  **Sensory Details:** The requirement to describe the "taste" or "scent" of emotions forces the AI to think creatively and generate unique, memorable imagery.
5.  **Defined Literary Style:** Specifying the genre, tone, POV, and literary devices acts as a "style guide" for the AI, ensuring the output matches the desired aesthetic.
6.  **Constraints as a Catalyst:** The word count and specific elements to include are not limitations but creative constraints. They force the AI to be more focused and deliberate in its writing.

### How to use it:

1.  Modify any of the core elements (Concept, Protagonist, Setting, etc.) to fit the story you want to create.
2.  You can be more or less prescriptive. For more AI freedom, provide only the Core Concept and Protagonist. For a more controlled output, make the plot points even more specific.
3.  This structure is modular. You can add other elements like "Key Theme," "Antagonist," or "A specific line of dialogue that must be included."
