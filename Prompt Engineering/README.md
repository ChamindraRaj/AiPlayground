# Prompt Engineering Library

This project contains a collection of engineered prompts designed to get high-quality, structured responses from Large Language Models (LLMs). The prompts are organized into logical categories based on their primary use case.

## Directory Structure

The prompts have been organized into the following categories:

### 1. Software Development
*Prompts for developers and engineers.*
- `code_generation_prompt.md`: Generates production-quality code for a given task.
- `code_reviewer_prompt.md`: Reviews a piece of code for bugs, style, and best practices.
- `test_case_generator_prompt.md`: Creates a comprehensive suite of test cases for a feature.
- `technical_document_translator_prompt.md`: Translates dense technical concepts into plain English.

### 2. Agile & Product Management
*Prompts for Iteration Managers, Agile Coaches, and Product Owners.*
- `retrospective_facilitator_prompt.md`: Facilitates a structured team retrospective.
- `user_story_refiner_prompt.md`: Refines a user story to ensure it is ready for development.
- `team_health_check_analyst_prompt.md`: Analyzes anonymous team feedback to summarize team health.
- `agile_principles_coach_prompt.md`: Helps a team apply Agile principles to solve real-world problems.
- `user_persona_generator_prompt.md`: Creates detailed user personas for product development.
- `five_whys_analyst_prompt.md`: Guides a root cause analysis using the "Five Whys" technique.

### 3. Learning & Critical Thinking
*Prompts designed to facilitate deep learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving.*
- `socratic_tutor_prompt.md`: Guides a user to an answer through questioning.
- `feynman_technique_explainer_prompt.md`: Helps a user learn by forcing them to teach a concept in simple terms.
- `debate_both_sides_prompt.md`: Articulates the strongest arguments for both sides of an issue.
- `mental_model_mapper_prompt.md`: Analyzes a problem through the lens of different mental models.
- `chain_of_thought_prompt.md`: Breaks down a complex problem into a series of logical steps.
- `research_assistant_prompt.md`: Conducts a preliminary research scan on an academic topic.
- `eli5_explainer_prompt.md`: Explains a highly complex topic as if to a five-year-old.

### 4. Content & Writing
*Prompts for generating creative ideas and written content.*
- `creative_writing_prompt.md`: Generates a creative story based on a structured set of inputs.
- `brainstorming_partner_prompt.md`: Facilitates a structured brainstorming session to generate a wide range of ideas.

### 5. Meta & Core Concepts
*Foundational prompts that define a structure or a core, reusable capability.*
- `persona_prompt.md`: Instructs the AI to adopt a specific persona for all subsequent responses.
- `information_extraction_prompt.md`: Extracts and structures specific pieces of information from unstructured text.
