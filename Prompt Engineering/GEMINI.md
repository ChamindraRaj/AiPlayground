# Directory Overview

This directory contains a collection of Markdown files, each detailing a specific "prompt engineering" technique for interacting with a large language model (LLM). The prompts are designed to elicit high-quality, structured responses for various tasks, such as code generation, creative writing, information extraction, and problem-solving.

# Key Files

*   `chain_of_thought_prompt.md`: Explains how to guide an AI to solve complex problems by breaking them down into logical steps.
*   `code_generation_prompt.md`: Provides a template for requesting production-quality code, complete with best practices like typing, docstrings, and unit tests.
*   `creative_writing_prompt.md`: A framework for generating imaginative short stories by providing the AI with structured creative constraints.
*   `information_extraction_prompt.md`: A prompt for accurately extracting and structuring data from unstructured text into a JSON format.
*   `persona_prompt.md`: Demonstrates how to assign a specific persona to the AI to ground its responses in a particular context and improve output quality.

# Usage

The files in this directory serve as templates and best-practice guides for writing effective prompts. They can be used as a reference or starting point when interacting with an LLM to achieve more reliable and sophisticated results for a variety of tasks. Each file includes a prompt template and documentation explaining why it is effective and how to use it.
